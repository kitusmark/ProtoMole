# ProtoMole - Permanent protoboard
the next step of prototiping. If you need your design somewhere more permanent, this is the protoboard to do it.

Sometimes I find myself wanting to have a circuit in a more fixed position, so I designed this permanent protoboard.

For now it's only in 5x5cm version but I'm planning to make a couple more sizes.

##How It's done

+ 0,1" standard pitch so you can fit almost everything. 
+ Small 5x5cm format
+ Double power rails. It has solder jumpers at the rear so you can connect both rails.
+ 3,2mm mounting holes
+ Small holes in the middle for an easy and clean break
+ Pins labeled with letters and numbers
+ Cheap, small and useful!
